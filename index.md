### Documentation

If you're a new user, visit the [tutorial](./tutorial) to see a walk-through of the entire API. You'll need about 5 minutes to read it all the way through, but feel free to take your time and try out the examples!

You can look at the [auto-generated documentation](./generated) to quickly find full examples of each part of the API.

You can also take a look at the [demo](./simple-ai), which contains:
* An AI system, making entities wander around, while avoiding walls.
* A collision detection system, ensuring you can't walk off the screen.
* A simple top-down movement system, with which you can control the player.
* A rendering system, making sure you can see what's going on. It uses the browser Canvas2D API.
